### Task
Write a paper explaining:
1. the data being shown
1. The purpose of the illustration
1. the type of visualization(s) being used
1. what aspects of the visualization are effective
1. what aspects of the visualization are misleading or ineffective
1. how the current visualization can be improved. Please feel free to refence other
visualizations that show similar data that you believe are more effect.

- Document must include at least one screenshot of the visualization
- Document must include a citation of reference of source of the visualization (i.e. link to website, citation of a paper or book, etc...)
- Project must be submitted through Blackboard
- Project must be submitted as a single .zip or tax.gz file with the following files:
   1. *Paper*. Paper that you wrote with the information requested above. Please use the following file format: your_lastname_project01.docx or your_lastname_project01.pdf

### Notes
1. the data being shown
   1. The figure shows distance a flight travels, the ports of those flights, the 
   change in price since 2014, and whether the flight is transatlantic. 
   1. Distance is encoded as length of a line.
   1. The ports are labled with text at the end of the line. 
   1. The change in price is encoded as an angle. An increase in price is a positive
   angle with repect to the x-axis, and a decrease is a negative angle. 
   1. Whether the flight was transatlantic is encoded with color: blue for transatlantic, gray otherwise. 
1. The purpose of the illustration
   1. The text above the graphic says: "most airfares have fallen since 2014, with 
   prices on transatlantic and long-haul routes declining the most".
   1. The point seems to be that the prices on certain types of flights have declined, 
   and this shows that correlation graphically. 
1. the type of visualization(s) being used
   1. The main type of graphic used is a "lollipop" plot, which is a type of bar chart. The lines are "sorted" by cost increase. 
   1. It also uses color encoding to denote two classes of flights. 
1. what aspects of the visualization are effective
   1. The length of the lines denoting the distance the flight travels is very clear. One can tell immediately which flights travel the farthest. The transatlantic flights also "pop" out of the page at the reader. 
1. what aspects of the visualization are misleading or ineffective
   1. I would argue that the encoding of change in price as an angle is ineffective, or at least not as effective as it could be. It makes it slightly harder to notice the two trends that the author wants to make evident. 
1. how the current visualization can be improved. Please feel free to refence other
visualizations that show similar data that you believe are more effect.
   1. If we apply the Gestalt Principles of Visual perception in the area of quantitative encoding, the best tools for encoding visual information are points, lines, and bars, and some combinations of those. The author is already encoding distance as the length of lines, which I think works well. However, humans are not as good at decoding angles; see the pie-chart bar-chart discussion. If instead we sort by price change and display them as a simple bar chart, I think this would be greatly improved. There is another option as well. The title at the top of the chart is clearly trying to tell us that there are some correlations in the data. Scatter plots are excellent for showing correlation. We could have distance on the x-axis, price change on the y-axis, and color the points in the same manner as they are on the current plot. If there is indeed a correlation between long-distance flights and price decreases, a scatter plot will make it more obvious. I belive the coloring will have about the same effect as it does in the current plot.
